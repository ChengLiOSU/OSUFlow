todo:

-diy repartitioning in Regular/Parallel
-diy AMR parallel and serial
-currently not using diy for AMR, still using LatticeAMR, but changed Seeds to be a vector, using current API, etc. Parallel AMR crashes and serial AMR never finishes. Need to debug these before changing over to diy, so that a working tests to compare against exists.

-there is a bug when running Regular/Serial/SER_TEST with time-varying and > 1 time block. Never finishes. I did not debug this, leave for OSU students if they are using this (may be an old bug-did not investigate)
