todo:
-Add different blocking and partitioning schemes (contiguous, space-filling curve)
-organize library into different modules (decomposition, communication, ...)
-add C++ examples:
  - blocking, reads, neighbor-communicates, merges, writes
  - eventually it would be good to have a full volume renderer, isosurfacer, and pathline tracer example
  - show how DIY can be used with vtk as the serial code to do an isosurface, and some serial rendering
-think about data models:
  -right now the user specifies a datatype (difficult and error-prone, requires advanced MPI knowledge, and the idea was to prevent that)
  -libraries exist to convert C structs and C++ classes to datatypes, build datatypes automatically (Automap, C++2MPI)
  -read rob's dataloop papers
-get Jay Lofstead's adios papers and read them
-change BIL to order dimensions in x,y,z Currently it is z,y,x a la MPI-IO
-future work: add support for open-mp MPI hybrid parallel model
-add unstructured blocking
-copy existing partitioning and repartitioning from osuflow into DIY
-test static example, write histogram and pdf and test merge
-test time_varying example
-make Blocking::InTimeBlock handle ghost cells, ignores them for now
-put bil's configure options in the top level configure (--with-pnetcdf, ...)
-add swap from MSC into diy
